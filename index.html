<h2>What are the basics of ice hockey?</h2>
<p>Hockey is an adrenaline filled sport which requires 3 basic skills:</p><ul><li>Skating<li>Puck Skills<li>On Ice Awareness</ul><p>These skills are essential to being the best you can be on the ice!</p>
<h2>How can I work on the three basic skills of hockey?</h2>    
<p>You can do many things including:</p><ul><li>Play against your friends<li>Practice balance (stand on one foot in random places)<li>Skate<li>Stickhandle with a ball<li>Shoot pucks</ul><p>There are a lot of other things you can do but those are some of the most practical things.</p>

<h2>What are some good stratagies for ice hockey?</h2>
<p>There are a lot of good stratagies for ice hockey but we will be talking about the very basics for positioning. I will be talking about PSB. What does PSB stand for? Here is what it stands for from a offensive position.</p><ul><li>Puck carrier - skates up the ice with the puck<li>Support - behind the puck carrier - helps when the puck is stolen from the puck carrier<li>Balance - is across from the puck carrier - can be used to get a goal and helps the puck carrier when the support cannot</ul><p>That is what it means from a offensive point of view. But what about an defensive point of view? Here is the difference:</p><ul><li>Puck Pursuiter - goes after the guy with the puck<li>Support - behind puck pursuiter - helps out the puck pursuiter when stuck<li>Balance - helps support when needed and is used to help move the puck faster</ul><p>PSB is like the bread and butter of ice hockey: it is the most important thing you will learn. Skating is also the bread and butter of hockey. If you can skate, you can blow by people all the time. If you dedicate all of your hockey time to learning skating and remembering PSB you can become a star.</p>
